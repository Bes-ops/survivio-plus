# Welcome to Surviv+! ðŸ˜ƒ

This is a Surviv.io multitool loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), transferred to [Kalaborative](https://github.com/Kalaborative) but since both have been away, I have decided to take ownership of the development of the code. 

It works by modifying the JS files sent from the server to the client, and adds scripts to enhance the user experience. 

If you like this project, and want it to last, please consider supporting.

## ðŸ¤” FAQ

> **What is "bump fire"?**

This is a feature for specific non-automatic guns (guns that you cannot hold down the left-click to shoot). By holding down left-click for these guns, they fire at the fastest rate acting like an automatic. (Think of it like an autoclicker.)
